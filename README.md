# BeatHeroes

Note: I started on Windows because I didn't have a Mac at the time to test on iOS.
When I did get a Mac, I never updated this version to match up with the iOS one until now, so there might be some bugs, but I don't want to go throug them right now

A prototype for a beat-based game like "Crypt of the Necrodancer".
