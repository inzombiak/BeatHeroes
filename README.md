# BeatHeroes

Note: I started on Windows because I didn't have a Mac at the time to test on iOS.
When I did get a Mac, I didnt keep this version up-to-date one until now, so there might be some bugs, but I don't want to go through them right now

I stopped working on it before I could do actual gameplay, but it was a good project to test my Lua wrapper on.
Controls:
Click and drag player - move
Click and drag in a circular way - rotate player
Right-click - attack

These controls may seem off, its because the game was aimed at iOS(which can be found [here](https://github.com/inzombiak/BeatHeroes-iOS))

A prototype for a beat-based game like "Crypt of the Necrodancer".
